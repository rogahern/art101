					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to create a file structure and be able to link files on one page. .</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble understanding how to create a list and link every single lab index file to the main page. But I was able figure it out after understanding the li command. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went really well. I was suprised at how much I was able to understand the file strcuture and organize the page effectively to create a clean product. </p>
